It complements the literature by providing information on the role of higher education institutions in developing skills for the circular plastic economy. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a mixed method approach drawing on reflective analysis on qualitative data from 5 focus groups and 12 semi-structured interviews, and structural equation modelling of quantitative data from 151 students across 4 Nigerian Universities. Findings: The results indicate that Nigerian university students are more likely to participate in the circular plastic economy through a high prominence of soft power features such as increased awareness, inspiration, idea generation, encouragement and capacity building. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of this study is with the sample. A larger data set, including other tertiary institutions such as private universities, polytechnics and schools of vocational studies, would strengthen the results. Practical implications: The study underlines the importance of targeted policy interventions and pedagogic innovations to drive awareness and knowledge building among Nigeria’s youth population. Originality/value: This study makes a novel contribution by using empirical evidence to determine the predictors of student participation in the circular plastic economy. This understanding is important for the development and implementation of appropriate policies that promote participation in the circular plastic economy. Furthermore, given the typical youthful age bracket of university students, any plans to achieve a systemic shift in the plastic value chain must involve the young generation.", "journal": "International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education", "volume": "26", "issue_number": "1", "keywords": ["Belgrade framework", "Circular economy", "Epistemic agency", "Plastics", "Students", "Human Factors and Ergonomics", "Education"], "fingerprints": ["Polytechnic", "Limitations", "Higher Education Institution", "Private Education", "Young Generation"], "publication_year": "2025", "publication_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/assessing-the-determinants-of-participation-in-the-circular-plast-2"},

Unlike those previous studies that took Sukuk or sharia-compliant firms, this study tests the impact of the proportion reported sharia-compliant debt financing in the balance sheet on the risk of price crash of a firm. Design/methodology/approach: Using the data from 2,752 firm-year observations of 344 Malaysian non-financial listed companies from 2012 to 2019, this article used a robust panel data estimation technique for statistical inferences. This study also employs panel GMM and quantile least squares as the robustness check. Findings: This study established a negative relationship between sharia-compliant debt financing and stock price crash risk. The robustness checks with different estimation techniques confirm the results. It implies that firms with a more significant proportion of Sharia-compliant financing tend to have lower future stock price crash risk. Practical implications: Consistent with the Islamic finance literature, the present study contributes to the existing literature on Islamic capital markets from the perspective of stock price crash risk because it is vital for risk management and investment decision-making as a measure of tail risk for stocks. The findings of this research will assist investors in developing portfolio strategies that incorporate firms with higher levels of sharia-compliant debt financing in their balance sheets. Additionally, the results of this study suggest that policymakers and regulatory bodies should consider revising their monitoring approaches for publicly listed firms.

It aims to uncover how competition moderates this relationship and to reveal the nonlinear dynamics between digital transformation and international diversification in strategic decision-making processes. Design/methodology/approach: Using a panel logistic regression analysis, this study examines data from 235 Malaysian nonfinancial listed companies from 2012 to 2019. The analysis focuses on the manufacturing and technology industries due to the availability of digital transformation data, leading to a data set of 1,180 year-firm observations. Findings: The results reveal a nonlinear relationship between digital transformation and international diversification, intensified by product market competition. Initially, digital transformation positively affects international diversification, but this effect turns negative as competition increases. Robustness checks validate these findings, indicating that competition’s impact varies with the level of digital transformation. Research limitations/implications: This study’s findings are based on text analysis as a proxy for digital transformation, which may not fully capture organizational changes. Future research could use reported transformation costs or mandatory disclosures. In addition, this study focuses solely on international diversification, excluding other forms of diversification and financial constraints. Practical implications: Policymakers should recognize that high product market competition can negate the benefits of digital transformation on internationalization. They need to balance promoting digital transformation with addressing competitive challenges. Managers should analyze the competitive landscape before pursuing international expansion, as high competition can diminish the advantages of digital transformation. Originality/value: This research enriches agency and resource-based view theories by revealing the complex dynamics between digital transformation, competition and international diversification.

Further, the authors extend the literature by investigating the moderating effect of ownership concentration levels (i.e. at 5%, 10% and 20%) on the relationship between corporate governance and the cost of equity. Design/methodology/approach: The study applies several robust panel regression techniques to a sample of 114 active non-financial companies listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange from 2011 to 2016. Corporate governance was measured through a unique index comprising 30 governance attributes. The cost of equity was measured through the capital asset pricing model. Further, the authors construct three variables for ownership concentration levels, i.e. at 5%, 10% and 20%. To address the endogeneity problem, the one-lagged variable model and GMM approaches were also applied. Findings: The results indicate that better corporate governance reduces the cost of equity, while ownership concentration at high thresholds would increase the cost of equity. Further, the authors find that ownership concentration at the 20% threshold moderates the relationship between corporate governance and the cost of equity. Thus, the authors argue that firms can minimize the risk faced by shareholders by implementing substantive corporate governance mechanisms.

However, very limited evidence has been provided on if environmental disclosure could drive firms to improve future environmental performance. Based on the competing theoretical predictions from the legitimacy theory and the “outside-in” management perspectives, this study provides new international insight into if carbon disclosure improvements could motivate future carbon performance improvement based on a change analysis. Particularly, the investigation uses a recently available carbon data set of both developed economies and developing economies from the Carbon Disclosure Project and other publicly available media platforms. We find that an improvement in carbon disclosure indicates a future carbon performance deterioration in developed economies, however, carbon disclosure changes are not related to future carbon performance changes in developing economies when using performance data from the Carbon Disclosure Project. When using performance data from other publicly available media platforms, carbon disclosure changes are not related to future carbon performance changes at all internationally.

Detecting the most important zombification feature using tree-based machine learning", "authors": ["Rayenda Khresna Brahmana"], "departments": "School of Economics, Finance and Accounting", "organizations": ["School of Economics, Finance and Accounting"], "abstract": "Tree-based machine learning models are crucial for identifying key features of company zombification, which remain underexplored in current literature focused solely on determinants. This study addresses this gap by employing machine learning feature analysis to identify and analyze the critical factors driving zombification, offering a fresh and data-driven perspective on the issue. Three different feature sets are examined: (i) Feature Zoo, (ii) Logistic regression-based, and (iii) Lasso-based features, focusing on critical internal characteristics of firms. These feature sets are applied to four tree-based algorithms—Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Model, and XGBoost—chosen for their white model capabilities, allowing the feature extractions. The results indicate that Debt and ROA consistently have the highest feature scores, suggesting they are crucial for predicting zombie companies. Additionally, the Lasso-based feature sets provide the best evaluation metrics, indicating that the two-step filtering process effectively improves the predictive model for zombie companies.

Design/methodology/approach: Initiating with a broad literature review to cement a theoretical backdrop on Islamic investment principles and the mechanics of shariah-compliant ETFs, the research progresses to devise a comparative analytical framework. This framework focuses on assessing ETF performance through metrics like net asset value returns and volatility, specifically analyzing Blackrock ETFs to draw distinctions in portfolio outcomes and asset compositions. Findings: The examination highlights discernible variances in portfolio performance between shariah-compliant and their conventional counterparts, presenting instances where shariah-compliant ETFs, such as ISUS from Blackrock, deliver competitive returns despite their generally lower net assets compared to conventional ETFs like VUSA from Vanguard. Moreover, the ISUS ETF‘s holdings investigation revealed discrepancies with AAOIFI standards, questioning its strict Shariah compliance and adding depth to the analysis of Islamic financial instruments‘ integrity. Originality/value: This paper significantly advances the scholarly dialogue on Islamic financial practices within the ETF landscape, providing empirical evidence of performance differentials and compliance intricacies.

Design/methodology/approach: Thomson Reuters ESG database, Compustat and Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) were used to derive a final sample size of 1,572 firms and 11,618 firm-year observations from 2003 to 2022. Fixed-effects regression was used to analyze the data. Findings: It was found that increasing ESG involvement leads to an increase in Z score (i.e. lower financial distress), and this impact was more profound during the COVID-19 period and also when firms' innovativeness increased.

By exploring the role of local communities in Nigeria, our findings highlight the changing context of ESA in emerging economies in which local communities, often referred to as weak and passive stakeholders, have forced multinational companies to respond to their commitment to ESA. However, the extent to which local communities’ voices can alter companies’ profit maximisation that compromises people’s welfare and the environment has caused concern. The power and influence wielded by companies, which has enabled them to devise a multitude of strategic responses, has subtly dominated local voices and actions, confining ESA practices largely to the content of their annual statements.

Some studies suggest these movies can positively affect student satisfaction, yet many criticize this method as ineffective or lazy. Our study compared two ways of using popular movies – watching them in class versus a flipped approach – for an advanced finance module. We aim to examine the best teaching delivery of watching popular movies in an advanced module. Design/methodology/approach: This study compares two teaching methods during movie screenings: a didactic flipped classroom (Group 01) and in-class viewing (Group 02). The sampling frame was final-year finance students from a public university. It was conducted over two academic years and involved 190 students aged 20–23. These students were split into two groups: G01, with 93 students, and G02, with 97 students. The study focused on the movie “Big Short,” chosen for its relevance to the Fixed-Income Securities course (the advanced module). Findings: Our findings indicate both methods led to high student satisfaction, with no significant difference between in-class viewing and the flipped approach. However, the understanding of the advanced module significantly increased overall. Importantly, using popular movies as flipped material resulted in better student grades compared to in-class viewing. This suggests that while using popular movies is a beneficial teaching method, employing a didactic flipped classroom approach yields superior outcomes for students. Practical implications: This research offers practical insights for instructors, highlighting the value of utilizing popular movies in advanced education. It suggests incorporating movies as learning materials can enhance student satisfaction, particularly when employed within a flipped classroom framework. Importantly, the study reveals that adopting the flipped classroom approach yields superior academic outcomes compared to traditional in-class viewing. Thus, instructors teaching advanced modules should consider integrating popular movies within flipped classrooms to not only enhance student satisfaction but also improve academic performance. Originality/value: Our research investigates popular movies' efficacy, particularly in advanced finance education. While previous studies have explored using movies to enhance student satisfaction, this study investigates it further by comparing two delivery methods: the didactic flipped classroom and traditional in-class viewing. While both methods effectively increase student satisfaction, the didactic flipped classroom significantly improves academic performance.

These business actors are mostly clustered in networked mechanic villages and provide micro-level CE business opportunities. However, their micro-level CE practices and business potentials has not been explored in the literature. This paper addresses this important gap by drawing on Network Theory to show how the network CE practices of these business actors contribute to waste reduction, resource conservation, and CE eco-innovation. We also show a missing connection between the CE practices of these business actors and existing network business models that can be exploited for their benefit.

The analysis involves developing a CGI tailored to the Indonesian context and examining its impact on the likelihood of firms becoming Zombie companies. Endogeneity concerns are addressed to ensure robustness. Post-hoc analyses investigate the roles of political connections and family ownership in the firm’s propensity to become Zombie firms. Findings: The results demonstrate that higher CGI scores are associated with a reduced likelihood of firms becoming Zombie companies, supporting the agency theory. Post-hoc analysis reveals that political connections and family ownership significantly contribute to a firm’s Zombie status. However, the influence of CGI remains crucial regardless of these factors. The findings are consistent with the literature, emphasizing the importance of effective corporate governance in preventing Zombification. Research limitations/implications: The study contributes to the academic literature by highlighting the importance of using a governance index to assess the impact of governance practices on firm dynamics. It highlights the relevance of corporate governance quality in understanding and mitigating Zombie theory. The research suggests further investigation into the role of CGI in helping companies transition from Zombie status to financial health and exploring the influence of upper-echelon variables on the CGI-Zombieness relationship. Practical implications: From a practical standpoint, the findings advocate for the enhancement of control and monitoring mechanisms in firms, particularly regarding debt risk-taking decisions. Policymakers are encouraged to institutionalize the use of governance indices to evaluate firm performance. The study suggests extending such regulations to non-listed firms and SMEs to prevent the proliferation of Zombie companies. Effective governance practices are crucial for mitigating risks associated with political connections and family ownership. Originality/value: This study provides a fresh perspective on the impact of the Corporate Governance Index on firm Zombieness within the Indonesian context. By tailoring the CGI to the specific regulatory framework, it offers reliable insights into the role of governance quality in preventing firms from becoming Zombies. The study bridges a gap in the literature by linking agency theory with Zombie theory, emphasizing the necessity of effective control and monitoring to avoid financial distress. The research highlights the pivotal role of corporate governance, even in the presence of political connections and family ownership.", "journal": "Asian Review of Accounting", "volume": "(In-Press)", "issue_number": null, "keywords": ["Agency theory", "Corporate governance", "Governance index", "Zombie companies", "G32", "G34", "D22", "L25", "Accounting", "Finance"], "fingerprints": ["Corporate Governance", "Ownership", "Agency Theory", "Regulatory Framework", "Zombie Firms", "Annual Report", "Legislation", "Indonesia"], "publication_year": "2025", "publication_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/does-the-corporate-governance-index-matter-for-company-zombificat"},

Despite this, the progress in realizing sustainable development remains as a challenge in the global perspective and yet it should be eliminated. The world is facing a pragmatic threat of climate change which potentially damage the Earth’s ecosystems. There is a need for all relevant parties to cooperatively care for the environment in decreasing the environmental degradation and climate change in achieving sustainability to leave no one left behind. Our study highlights the perception of the firm at firm-level that can link environmental sustainability practices and firm performance, especifically in the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Hence, in this study, we will examine how corporate sustainability orientation influences firm performance, and how corporate sustainability orientation influences firm performance through environmental practices with the use of the Natural Resource-based View (NRBV) theory and Stakeholder theory.

A total of 219 responses were collected and this study uses a Partial Least Squares – Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) approach in data analysis. From the analysis, both corporate sustainability orientation and environmental practices were found significant, while the relationship between corporate sustainability orientation and firm performance was found significant through the indirect effect.

We further examine how that relationship may be varied across different controlling share-holders. For robustness reasons, we test it in a developing market and a developed market. Background Problems: Economics and business theories state that research and development (R&D) is susceptible to financing constraints due to the lack of collateral value and asymmetric information issues. This argument has been extensively debated with no consensus being reached. Therefore current study focuses on the examination of R&D and cash holding and the role of controlling shareholders. Novelty: The current study considers the importance of controlling shareholders on the relationship between cash holding and R&D intensity. We expect that different controlling shareholders will have different constraints on R&D financing. Research Methods: This study focuses on a sample of public listed companies in Malaysia and Singapore from the year 2012 to 2018, and estimates the model under a two-step GMM panel regression to eliminate the endogeneity issue. Finding/Results: The results show that cash holdings have significant effects on the intensity of R&D. However, that relationship is different across countries and across controlling shareholders. Malaysia's foreign firms will increase their R&D's intensity when their cash holdings are high. Meanwhile, Singaporean family firms will reduce the intensity of their R&D when their cash holdings are high. Overall the findings confirm the hypothetical alignment of the agency theory and also the resource-based view theory. Conclusion: Our findings surmise that higher cash holdings cause a lower R&D intensity due to the cash management decisions by managers. A firm with high leverage tends to reduce its R&D intensity when cash holdings are high, and vice versa. This behavior can be found in all the controlling shareholders.", "journal": "Journal of Indonesian Economy and Business", "volume": "38", "issue_number": "1", "keywords": ["cash holdings", "controling shareholders", "innovation", "R&D intensity", "Management Information Systems", "Business and International Management", "Accounting", "Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)", "Economics and Econometrics", "Management of Technology and Innovation"], "fingerprints": ["Research and Development", "Shareholders", "Enterprise", "Asymmetric Information", "Share", "Economics", "Resource-Based View", "Leverage"], "publication_year": "2023", "publication_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/cash-holdings-and-rampd-intensity-with-different-controlling-shar"},

We used multiple frequency datasets of global financial stock market indexes that span over 20 years to have comprehensive analysis and robustness in the results. The study is performed from distinct sub-sample periods of the global financial crisis, including the pre-crisis period (2000–2007), the crisis and post-crisis period (2008–2020), and the overall sample period (2000–2020). We observed seven stock markets in the total sample period and twelve in the pre-crisis period, which were weak-form efficient across different frequency data sets. During the crisis and post-crisis period, just four out of sixteen stock market indexes were found to be weak in efficiency based on Fourier unit root tests. Given the superior properties of the Fourier unit root tests, this study reiterates that investors may receive a stream of arbitrage benefits in all markets due to the inefficiency of these countries.

Furthermore, we find this positive association to be more pronounced for firms operating in the following settings: higher labour union density, more industry peer firms and more flexible labour market regulations. Overall, these findings support the view that employee shareholding enhances the quality of financial reporting by aligning the interests of employees with those of shareholders through two channels: reduced agency problems and enhanced employee retention.

In general, all organisations report information of some kind. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR) were fields developed from approximately the 1950s and have presented important applications, especially in the last three decades. Nevertheless, applications in accounting and finance have not developed accordingly, and a comprehensive framework is missing in the existing literature. This paper examines how NLP and IR can facilitate reporting and disclosure, both Financial and Non-Financial. The paper provides a brief literature review on NLP/IR applications in accounting and finance. It better informs and expands on the discussion of NLP/IR applications in academic research, professional organisations (i.e., IFRS), and industry. It explores some innovative applications of NLP/IR in unstructured data and its use in reporting and disclosure and FinTech applications. The main contribution is the definition of a complete framework that consistently analyses the possible NLP/IR applications in the accounting processes. We find that there can be many more applications of NLP/IR in accounting and finance and suggest future directions for research.", "journal": null, "volume": null, "issue_number": null, "keywords": [], "fingerprints": ["Information Retrieval", "Application", "Natural Language Processing", "Financial Reporting", "Roadmap", "Information", "Accounting", "Finance"], "publication_year": "2022", "publication_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/nlp-and-ir-applications-for-financial-reporting-and-non-financial"},

Indeed, the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (UN-2030-ASD) and the G20 High-Level Principles for Digital Financial Inclusion (G20-HLP-DFI) highlight the importance of harnessing the potential of FinTech to reduce financial exclusion and income inequality. This paper investigates the interrelationship between FinTech, financial inclusion and income inequality for a panel of 140 countries using the Global Findex waves of survey data for 2011, 2014 and 2017. We posit that FinTech affects inequality directly and indirectly through financial inclusion. We invoke quantile regression analysis to investigate whether such effects differ across countries with different levels of income inequality. We uncover new evidence that financial inclusion is a key channel through which FinTech reduces income inequality. We also find that while financial inclusion significantly reduces inequality at all quantiles of the inequality distribution, these effects are primarily associated with higher-income countries. Overall, our results support the aspirations of the UN-2030-ASD and G20-HLP-DFI.

Using data for 162 countries over 1995–2014 (i.e., 3240 observations) and drawing on distinctive insights from diffusion theory, we found that common law countries tend to adopt ISAs faster than civil law countries. Our findings also show that vigorous legal enforcement and shareholder protection regimes promote the early adoption of ISAs, whereas robust judicial efficiency systems constrain the early adoption of ISAs. In addition, our results show that higher literacy rates and educational attainment simulate the earlier diffusion of ISAs. We also find that higher levels of individualism and uncertainty avoidance, but low levels of power distance cultural values, boost the early adoption of ISAs.

Design/methodology/approach: The study draws on capture theory to bring out the factors that have rendered redundant the state intervention to make corporations accountable for their environmental activities. The research setting is the oil and gas and cement industry in Nigeria. Data for the study are derived from both documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews and analysed using a thematic technique. Findings: The findings of the paper demonstrate a regulatory failure to hold corporations to account for their environmental activities. A lack of political will, outdated regulations and the manipulation of the regulators, all have played a part in preventing corporations from being accountable for their activities. In addition, the widespread elite corruption in the country has provided corporations with leeway to manipulate their environmental accountability practices. The study emphasises the need for continuous review of the regulations and efforts to reduce corruption in order to promote corporations' environmental accountability in Nigeria. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited to Nigeria, oil and gas and cement industries. The theoretical lens can be used to address problem of capture of the regulations and institution in the country. Practical implications: The practical implication is that it would enhance environmental regulations in Nigeria and emerging economies. It will also provide support from researchers emerging markets on the adoption of capture theory in future research. Social implications: It will promote corporate best environmental practices in the country. It will reduce the issues surrounding environmental accountability practices and create awareness on environmental issues among the populace. It will create the impression that corporations will be held accountable for their environmental activities in the country and the need to have improved environmental regulations in the country. Originality/value: The study adds to the debate on corporate environmental accountability practices engendering insights from the Nigerian oil and gas and cement industry.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a panel of 2,538 public companies listed with the New York Stock Exchange to explain the impact of corporate governance deviance on firm’s performance. The authors relied on unique governance variables extracted from the Bloomberg database to develop the governance deviance index. Findings: Study unveils that deviance from governance practices influences firm’s performance. Consequently, it can be said that the firms which use innovative governance mechanisms, usually stay ahead of the market by leading the governance trends. The findings also generalise the firm’s entrepreneurial identity and organisational ecology perspectives. Research limitations/implications: Research implies that the firm’s entrepreneurial identity demands innovative managerial control. This study is focused on the US financial market, but in future, researchers could revalidate the deviance index. Scholars can also use mixed methods to test the need for innovative governance mechanisms in emerging markets. Practical implications: The firms should focus on innovative governance practices not only to safeguard the firm’s entrepreneurial identity but also to pursue the growth objectives. Such innovative mechanisms and managerial controls are helpful to deal with industrial transformations to satisfy key stakeholders.

The Case of Australian Mercury Accounting via the National Pollutant Inventory", "authors": ["Hafij Ullah, James Hazelton, Peter Nelson"], "departments": "School of Economics, Finance and Accounting", "organizations": ["School of Economics, Finance and Accounting", "Macquarie University"], "abstract": "Purpose: This paper furthers research into the potential contribution of pollutant databases for corporate accountability. We evaluate the quality of corporate and government mercury reporting via the Australian National Pollutant Inventory (NPI), which underpins Australia's reporting under the Minamata Convention, a global agreement to reduce mercury pollution. Design/methodology/approach: The qualitative characteristics of accounting information are used as a theoretical frame to analyse ten interviews with thirteen interviewees as well as 54 submissions to the 2018 governmental enquiry into the NPI. Findings: While Australian mercury accounting using the NPI is likely sufficient to meet the expected Minamata reporting requirements (especially in comparison to developing countries), we find significant limitations in relation to comparability, accuracy, timeliness and completeness. These limitations primarily relate to government (as opposed to industry) deficiencies, caused by insufficient funding. The findings suggest that multiple factors are required to realise the potential of pollutant databases for corporate accountability, including appropriate rules, ideological commitment and resourcing Practical implications: The provision of additional funding would enable the NPI to be considerably improved (for mercury as well as other pollutants), particularly in relation to the measurement and reporting of emissions from diffuse sources. Originality/value: Whilst there have been prior reviews of the NPI, none have focused on mercury, whilst conversely prior studies which have discussed mercury information have not focused on the NPI. In addition, no prior NPI studies have utilised interviews nor have engaged directly with NPI regulators.

{"title": "Bank solvency: The role of credit and liquidity risks, regulatory capital and economic stability", "authors": ["Isaiah Oino"], "departments": "School of Economics, Finance and Accounting", "organizations": ["School of Economics, Finance and Accounting", "College of Business & Law"], "abstract": "Banking stability is essential to any economy due to its many functions, including intermediation, payment facilitation, and credit creation. Thus, the stability of the banking industry is one of the critical ingredients in economic growth. This paper analyzes how bank capital, credit and liquidity requirements impact bank solvency, using ten major banks controlling 90% of the UK market share in 2009-2018. The GMM model indicates a strong association between credit and liquidity risks. That is, when banks finance a risky or distressed project, this will lead to an increase in nonperforming loans (NPL), which reduces bank liquidity. Poor liquidity profile of a bank may restrict its ability to act as a financial intermediary. In addition, the findings indicate that efficiency, asset quality, and economic growth have a significant positive effect on the solvency of banks. The results also show that the regulatory capital (Tier1) has a positive significant influence on bank solvency. Further, the results indicate that during the economic boom, banks tend to increase their regulatory capital. Therefore, there is a need to ensure that during the \"good time\", banks can accumulate enough capital that is genuinely capable of absorbing negative shock. Also, it is important for banks to ensure that they are efficient but also have a robust credit appraisal system to reduce NPL. This paper also demonstrates the implications of increased capital requirements. That is, increased capital requirements ensure not only banks are liquid but also solvent, which allows them to provide financial intermediation.", "journal": "Banks and Bank Systems", "volume": "16", "issue_number": "4", "keywords": ["Banks", "Capital", "Efficiency", "GDP", "Profitability", "Risks", "Stability", "Finance", "Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management", "Marketing", "Management of Technology and Innovation", "Law"], "fingerprints": ["Credit", "Economics", "Liquidity", "Bank Solvency", "Banking", "Capital Requirements", "Non-Performing Loan", "Payment System"], "publication_year": "2021", "publication_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/bank-solvency-the-role-of-credit-and-liquidity-risks-regulatory-c"},

{"title": "A Historical Institutionalist Perspective on the Persistence of State Controls during Financial Sector Reforms: The Insightful Case of Myanmar", "authors": ["Sandar Win, Alexander Kofinas"], "departments": "School of Economics, Finance and Accounting", "organizations": ["School of Economics, Finance and Accounting", "University of Bedfordshire"], "abstract": "Purpose: Many transition economies are former socialist planned economies and have undergone market reforms of their financial sector to signal their transition towards democracy. However, governments in these countries have been reluctant to relinquish the pre-existing controls on economy and have adopted nuanced and sophisticated approaches to retain control. In such context, scholars may find it challenging to investigate the role played by the state in the success or failure of attempted market reforms. This work investigates the different forms of state-induced accounting controls that may preserve the status quo within the economy during transition, using Myanmar as an example. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopted a longitudinal qualitative research method aiming to reveal the very processes and mechanisms used by the banks and their evolution over time. This method is in accordance with the historical institutionalist perspective that they have applied within this research. Findings: The authors found that the Myanmar government embarked on the privatisation of their financial sector from 1990 to 2016 as a major public sector reform initiative. Under the guise of market reforms, it used both state-led and market-led controls to emulate and retain the socialist banking model where banks are used to fund the immediate government's budget deficits. This created a series of intended and unintended consequences, resulting in the ultimate failure of the government's market reforms. Research limitations/implications: Previously, research on public sector management accounting in emerging economies was not relying consistently on using theory. The relative limited theorisation led to gaps when attempting to understand and explain the opaque forms of state control mechanisms in transition economies. By applying historical institutionalist perspective, and a more theory-driven, reflective approach to the interpretation of the data collected, the authors have provided a deeper insight and understanding on how different forms of state controls can emerge, adapt and persist in transition economies such as Myanmar. Practical implications: The authors demonstrated that though the state may have implemented market reforms to signal regimes change, this does not necessarily mean that the government has relinquished their control on the economy. The state could take a more sophisticated, covert approach towards state controls leading to both intended and unintended consequences. Thus, even if the state's preferences change, the decisions cannot be easily reversed, as path-dependent state controls may have become pervasive affecting any further institutional and policy developments. Thus, the authors suggest that governments in both transition and developed economies should be cautious when enacting regulations on corporate control. Originality/value: In this paper, the authors have applied a historical institutional perspective in their analysis instead of the more widely used sociological, institutionalist approach. This allowed authors to harness rich longitudinal data indicating that market reforms and their success or failure should be examined as an ongoing process rather than a completed action. This is especially important in transition economies where the state may be unwilling to renounce the existing controls on the industry and may resort to more opaque forms of state control, eventually obstructing the intended reforms.", "journal": "Journal of Accounting in Emerging Economies", "volume": "11", "issue_number": "1", "keywords": ["Financial reforms", "Historical institutionalism", "Market reforms", "Privatisation", "Public sector", "State controls", "Accounting", "Development", "Sociology and Political Science"], "fingerprints": ["State", "State Control", "Markets", "Control", "Government", "Authors", "Myanmar", "Perspective"], "publication_year": "2021", "publication_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/a-historical-institutionalist-perspective-on-the-persistence-of-s"},

We address whether there is a long-run relationship between exports and tourism and the direction of causality between these two variables. Our findings suggest a long-run relation between Singapore’s exports and inbound tourism and that the causation is bidirectional. This implies that inbound tourism in Singapore results in a higher demand for its domestic products. This increased demand for Singaporean products, in turn, acting as a positive advertising campaign in favor of Singapore, promotes inbound tourism to this country. The policy implication of these findings is twofold. First, inbound tourism in Singapore not only contributes directly to GDP, employment, and the current account via tourism revenues but also by stimulating exports it improves further the current account of Singapore. Secondly, the stimulation of exports induced by inbound tourism creates favorable sustainability conditions for the entire tourism sector. However, one should be cautious that this effect is taking more than 9 months to materialize and that inbound tourism may initially have a negative impact effect on Singapore’s exports as the overtime effect of tourism on exports exhibits a J-curve behavior.", "journal": "Tourism Analysis", "volume": "27", "issue_number": "2", "keywords": ["Causality", "Cointegration", "J-curve", "Singapore", "Tourism", "Trade", "Tourism, Leisure and Hospitality Management"], "fingerprints": ["Tourism", "Singapore", "Current Account", "Policy", "Overtime", "Behavior", "Advertising Campaign", "Employment"], "publication_year": "2022", "publication_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/tourism-and-exports-the-case-of-singapore"},

First, it assesses existing local accounting and financial reporting practices in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), focusing on the extent to which recent government financial statements published by ten selected countries adhere to mainstream qualitative features of public sector reporting. Second, it investigates the multiple institutional logics at play in the context of government accounting reforms (GARs) in SSA, involving international organisations, epistemic community members, policy makers and local actors. Data for the study are drawn from a content analysis and disclosure scoring of ten SSA government financial statements, supplemented by forty semi-structured interviews carried out in Nigeria and Tanzania. Our findings demonstrate how the generalised assumptive logics of international organisations, coupled with the market and professional logics of epistemic community members and state logics of local politicians, have led to the marginalisation of ‘good’ existing accounting and financial reporting practice in SSA (as reflected by the extent to which government financial statements adhere to mainstream features of public sector reporting) - while providing the countries with a strong impetus for undertaking a transition towards large-scale GARs involving accrual accounting and IPSASs. The role of the epistemic community in selectively ignoring the positive aspects of local accounting practice is a significant impediment. In this way, members of this epistemic community continue to execute their ‘relational power’ generated through professional knowledge, expertise and elite connections over the local actors, hence upholding the generalised assumptive logics. The paper argues that public accountability and transparency can be strengthened in SSA countries provided there is an ‘intelligent’ application of existing regulations and accounting systems, rather than seeking to merely replace them with externally imposed large-scale GARs.", "journal": "Critical Perspectives on Accounting", "volume": "78", "issue_number": null, "keywords": ["Epistemic community", "Government accounting reforms", "Institutional logics", "Sub-Sahara Africa", "Accounting", "Finance", "Sociology and Political Science", "Information Systems and Management"], "fingerprints": ["Logic", "Financial Statement", "Africa", "Communities", "Accounting", "Public Accounting", "Government", "Practice"], "publication_year": "2021", "publication_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/government-accounting-reforms-in-sub-saharan-african-countries-an-2"},

Nine major databases were analyzed to review research articles from various business, management, higher education, and accounting journals for the period of 2004–2020. We follow the seven-step systematic review guidelines developed by Fink 2019 and we base our review analysis on fifty-eight journal articles. The systematic literature review results show a significant increase in the number of CSR article publications and the extent and trend of disclosure. The majority of prior research was based on questionnaires to evaluate the HEIs curriculum and focus on the CSR implication process. However, HEIs are still lagging behind in CSR implication and disclosure, and with a long way to go to obtain sustainability goals. From the study, several opportunities for future research emerged.

This study is based on a large survey undertaken at a UK Business School at the beginning of course induction meetings for 1st year undergraduate students. The results reveal that there is a significant misalignment between students' university feedback expectations and actual university feedback.

In addition to the stimulus packages to adjust the economic shock from COVID-19, regulators around the world are searching for innovative mechanisms to rebuild the economy. The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential of SRI Sukuk to serve as an Islamic social finance solution for development projects to mitigate the adverse economic effects of COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a mixed-method research framework. The authors use a systematic literature review following the recommendations of Bowen (2009) to identify critical challenges financing PPP projects using SRI Sukuk. In the next phase, the authors interview participants involved in an SRI Sukuk financed PPP project to get more significant insights on the challenges identified through the literature review process. Findings: The authors identify the need for greater transparency for SRI financed PPP projects. Also, organisational and legislative challenges are limiting the attractiveness of SRI Sukuk as a financing mechanisms for post-COVID development projects. Practical implications: SRI Sukuk is an emerging financing concept, and the use of such an Islamic financial instrument in financing development projects can serve as a viable alternative for policymakers in a post-COVID economic environment. Social implications: The successful completion of the development projects integrating the concept of Social Maslahah through SRI Sukuk in Malaysia could encourage other emerging economies to use such innovative Islamic financial instrument for economic development in post-COVID environment.

Design/methodology/approach: This study adds to institutional management accounting research using a multi-level perspective of institutional dynamics in the smart city context. Data were collected from an interpretive case study of an Egyptian SOE that was under socio-political sustainability pressures to implement a smart electricity network project in New Minya city. Findings: Smart city projects have formed social and political sustainability pressures, which introduced the enterprise resource planning (ERP) network as a new management accounting system. A new (complex and multi-level) management accounting system was invented to reinvent the sustainable city as an “accounting city” (which appeared rhetorically as a “smart city”). “Smart” being the visibility and measurability of the sustainability performance of the collective body, which calls the city and its connectivity to different institutional levels brought out in a city network project for the ERP-enabled electricity distribution. Research limitations/implications: This study examines a single case study from a single smart city and identifies the accounting community’s need for multiple and comparative case studies to further analyse the potential impact of smart city reforms and projects on the sustainable implementation of management accounting systems. Practical implications: City policymakers and managers may benefit from the practical findings of this interpretive field-based case study in planning, implementing and monitoring smart city projects and objectives. Social implications: Individual and collective well-being may be enhanced through new management accounting forms of multi-level local governance and increased political, field and organisational sustainability.

Increased noise, outliers and structural changes in the series, all too common in practice, can severely affect the quality of forecasting. We investigate ways to increase the reliability of exponential smoothing forecasts, the most widely used family of forecasting models in business forecasting. We consider two alternative sets of approaches, one stemming from statistics and one from machine learning. To this end, we adapt M-estimators, boosting and inverse boosting to parameter estimation for exponential smoothing. We propose appropriate modifications that are necessary for time series forecasting while aiming to obtain scalable algorithms. We evaluate the various estimation methods using multiple real datasets and find that several approaches outperform the widely used maximum likelihood estimation.

The research paper starts from the reality that finance plays an important role in each economy. Nowadays, finance has to manage and adapt to Digital Era. The purpose of this paper is an attempt to identify and encourage managing financial statements through artificial intelligence using XBRL and Blockchain. In many countries, financial and tax authorities encourage the adoption of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) and Blockchain. XBRL enable business to generate their required reporting information directly from their financial data. Blockchain technology continues to grow and it is being used in more and more business sectors. Finance, accounting and auditing has been identified as areas that could greatly benefit the distributed registry and other features of Blockchain. The main benefits generated by these innovative tools include reducing the risk of error (especially human error); low risk of fraud; system automation, big data analysis, huge cost savings (by increasing the efficiency and decreasing in errors), increased reliability in financial reports, and reduced workflow. The research paper comes to present how artificial intelligence combine financial information with tech capabilities, accelerate digital transformation of finance and accounting, and may create a more safety business and economic environment, reducing human error.

It answers the research question: how accounting-based key performance indicators (KPIs) were chosen within a privatised SE to maintain co-existence between two different institutional logics, the social and commercial logics, to gain legitimacy in the government funding scheme. Design/methodology/approach: This study expands the application and contribution of the Besharov and Smith’s (2014) logics multiplicity framework to previous management accounting literature on PMS and institutional logics. It adds a new dimension to previous literature to theorise the cognitive dynamics of institutional logics at three distinct but interrelated institutional levels, namely, field, organisational and individual. Data come from an interpretive case study of an Egyptian SE, involved in implementing a social project (drinking water refining) in rural communities. Findings: PMS acts as a political tool through which the privatised case company has gained societal acceptance and legitimacy in the government funding scheme. Its non-political KPIs have turned into political tools to meet the institutional demands of the funding scheme. This government involvement represents field-level institutional logics, which influenced the organisational-level interplay of commercial and social logics and then the individual-level choice of internal KPIs. This contributes to the fact that institutional logics and their interplay between these three levels are “in a state of flux” within SEs’ internal PMS. Originality/value: This study deals with a real-life practical case that proves the prevalence of one institutional logic over another at both the organisational and individual levels may be occasioned by organisational field pressures and opportunities rather than by other intra-organisational conflicts as discussed in most previous literature on PMS and institutional logics.", "journal": "Qualitative Research in Accounting & Management", "volume": "18", "issue_number": "1", "keywords": ["Social enterprises", "Performance measurement systems", "Government involvement", "Institutional logics", "Key performance indicators", "Egypt", "Performance measurement system", "Accounting", "Business and International Management"], "fingerprints": ["Logic", "Institutional Logic", "Metrology", "Measurement System", "Company", "Funding", "Enterprises", "Social Enterprise"], "publication_year": "2021", "publication_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/the-influence-of-institutional-pressures-on-the-implementation-of"},

Applying a pooled fixed-effects model on a complete panel of 179 banks from 2008 to 2019 in the European Union, the results show how banks in Europe strive to achieve profitability requirements at the same time meeting the regulatory hurdles.

Also, the findings indicate that higher capital requirements for banks significantly positively influence liquidity. Furthermore, there is an inverse relationship between growth in loans and total regulatory capital.

The specific hypotheses under investigation relate to the method of payment (cash versus stock), target status (listed versus non-listed), diversification (domestic versus cross-border and industry-wide) and acquirers’ prior bidding experience. Additionally, the authors also investigate whether announced deals reflect an expectation about likelihood of deal completion. Design/methodology/approach: The authors analyse the probability of deal success/failure in M&As by combining event study and probit regression-based methods. The authors use the standard event study methodology to calculate acquirers’ abnormal returns for up to 10 days before and after the announcement date. In the probit model, the dependent variable is the probability of deal i being failure depending on four sets of explanatory variables: method of payment, target status, diversification and acquirer bidding experience, along with a set of control variables. Findings: The findings from event study confirm that market reaction is indifferent to whether announced deals are likely to be successfully completed or not, consistent with the efficient markets hypothesis. However, the results from cross-sectional, cross-country regressions confirm that the aforementioned deal characteristics, as well as certain firm and country level attributes do influence the likelihood of whether an announced deal is subsequently completed or terminated. Originality/value: In examining whether the specific characteristics affecting the likelihood that M&A transactions, once announced, will ultimately succeed or fail, it seems natural to ask whether the market reaction at the time of deal announcement reflects an expectation regarding deal completion. This could be associated with specific deal or firm-level characteristics influencing shareholder returns or risk, and represents a unique contribution of this study, over and above the use of a global sample of M&A data.

Design/methodology/approach: This study extends the application and contribution of a multi-level institutional framework to previous management accounting literature on the potential relationship between performance measurement and smart city governance. The value of utilising a multi-level framework is to broaden and deepen theoretical analyses about this relationship to include the effect of political pressure from the military regime at the macro level on the institutionalisation of a performance measurement system at the micro-organisational level. Taking the New Cairo city council smart electricity networks project (Egypt) as an interpretive qualitative single-case study, data collection methods included semi-structured interviews, direct observations and documentary readings. Findings: Performance measurement systems or metrics, especially in politically and militarily sensitive smart cities, constitutes a process of cascading (macro-micro) institutionalisation that is closely linked to sustainable developments taking place in the wider arena of urban policies. Going a step further, accounting-based performance metrics, arising from political and military pressures towards public-private collaborations, contribute to smart city management and accountability (governance). Institutionalised measurement systems or performance metrics play a powerful accounting role(s) in shaping and reshaping political decisions and military actions in the city council. Originality/value: Theoretically, this study goes beyond the cascading institutionalisation process by arguing for the powerful role(s) of institutionalised accounting and performance measurement systems in smart city decision-making and governance.

The methodology established by the risk management standard-setting body for Islamic banks, the IFSB, estimates an alpha for each country using panel-data and normally distributed asset returns for its credit institutions. Consequently, the IFSB methodology precludes bank-specific alphas linked to the actual risk profile of underlying assets. There is also no discernible mapping between alpha and a bank's own propensity to subsidise cash returns. This paper instead develops a new theoretical model for bank-specific alpha that is estimated for 43 Islamic banks in 11 countries. Our alpha values broadly correspond with those of the IFSB. However, a form of regulatory arbitrage is shown to exist which favors banks with relatively high alphas.

However, information systems are not only limited to accounting for the management of a company, but it is often necessary to implement additional information systems to manage other operational aspects such as inventory management, personnel, security, big data management for marketing and the provision of a broad corporate strategy. All these aspects, in general, in order to lead the company towards success, must be integrated with each other. Many software can manage all these aspects of management, but they do not allow integrated management and top management cannot control and reconcile all information. For this reason Enterprise resource plannings (ERPs), formed by different modules, are very common. ERPs allow the flow of information to be managed in an integrated manner using a single system, avoiding duplication, errors and loss and information. All the operations are reported systematically also and above all on the accounting module, which is the one that guides all the others. This research paper is focused on the comparison of currently most used AISs and ERPs in the UAE, also analyzing the market and the size of businesses in the area.

Colonisation left behind legacies of institutional framework, social ties and remnants of companies of colonial masters, which could potentially offer contemporary businesses from home countries the benefits of country of origin agglomeration. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses sequential explanatory mixed research design through 101 questionnaires and 8 interviews from the UK companies with FDI in Ghana. This approached enabled the initial quantitative results to be explored further through the qualitative data. Findings: Colonial ties have limited influence on contemporary flow of FDI to Ghana, in spite of the institutional legacies between former colonisers and colonies. Majority of UK companies are influenced by agglomeration opportunities in general rather than country of origin agglomeration. However, country of origin agglomeration remains important to over a third of the companies surveyed. Research limitations/implications: The sample was taken from the non-extractive industry in Ghana, and caution must be applied in generalising the findings. However, some universal issues concerning agglomeration and institutions are discussed. Originality/value: Although there has been some research on colonial history and its impact on FDI in Africa, existing knowledge on bilateral relations is rather limited. Unlike previous studies, this research provides depth by examining colonial influence on FDI between two countries, using two key concepts: country of origin agglomeration and institutions. It provides UK companies with contemporary views to consider when exploring FDI opportunities in Ghana, particularly in relation to the effects of the colonial history. It also provides investment promotion agencies with empirical results on the importance of various forms of agglomeration and institutions for FDI attraction.", "journal": "Critical Perspectives on International Business", "volume": "16", "issue_number": "3", "keywords": ["Africa", "Agglomeration", "Bilateral trade", "Colonial legacies", "Country of origin", "FDI determinants", "FDI motives", "Ghana", "Institutions", "UK companies", "Business and International Management", "Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)"], "fingerprints": ["Foreign Investment", "Enterprise", "Institution", "Investment Policy", "Knowledge", "Specific Industry", "Research Design"], "publication_year": "2020", "publication_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/it-is-not-what-you-think-the-effect-of-colonial-legacies-on-afric"},

Inserted in an environmental context, the knowledge of the variables that influenced his life allowed him to reap daily benefits and ultimately ensured his survival. Weather forecasts, bets on sports results, financial analysis, estimation of life span probabilities, to name just a few examples, are based on increasingly accurate estimates thanks to increasingly efficient statistical techniques and detection tools. Risk and uncertainty, however, although increasingly limited, represent an essential variable of any future event. The possibility of measuring and preventing (even if close to their occurrence) unlikely, but potentially catastrophic events, can determine extraordinary competitive advantages or even just guarantee the survival of a business or human existence. Unlikely events, but catastrophic, are the so-called \"black swans\"[1], and represent the nightmare of those who rely on the Gaussian approach, since, even if they fall into the tails of the bell, they represent a non-negligible threat. Studies on the black swan, especially after the events linked to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, have brought to light the so-called fractal approach that comes closest to the occurrence of most natural events. The analysis of big data, focused on the identification of the black swan, can follow different paths, in any case, the \"normal\"Gauss curve, as demonstrated, does not lend itself to this type of analysis, therefore most of the statistical tools which are based on this are not suitable for these analyses.

Business sustainability, among all management tasks, heavily depends on successful integration between supply chain and logistics. Scholarly and academic double-blinded peer-reviewed journals, indexed in Scopus and EBSCO, are considered, in a time range between the years 2010 and 2019. Thus, summaries of journals are comprehensively assessed to appraise the integration between Sustainable Supply Chain Management and logistics in business markets. Through this work paper, the procedures behind an effective application of supply chain models are investigated in order to improve knowledge, in terms of recent advancements. The authors develop and carry out an effective business-case analysis, in which the application of Supply Chain Management and logistics procedures led to advancements in the field, therefore their systematic review will be beneficial in terms of a comprehensive current framework provision. According to the analyze explored by the authors, Decision Support Systems and computer frameworks really support business leaders in using Sustainable Supply Chain Management and logistics information and models, further providing specific training. The research paper observed that, indeed, a systematic review is an effective tool that encourages a thorough understanding of the key features related to the specific field. Despite limitations due to a small number of studies carried out on the specific topic, we strongly believe that this research will provide a great contribution to business management, towards an exhaustive, useful, and insightful analysis of the current studies on the integration between Sustainable Supply Chain Management and logistics applications.", "journal": "Quality - Access to Success", "volume": "21", "issue_number": "176", "keywords": ["Corporate social responsibility", "Sustainability", "Sustainable supply chain management", "Systematic literature review", "Management Information Systems", "Business and International Management", "Strategy and Management"], "fingerprints": ["Supply Chain Management", "Logistics", "Integration", "Simulation Mode", "Enterprises", "Research", "Application", "Paper"], "publication_year": "2020", "publication_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/sustainability-integration-in-supply-chain-management-through-sys"},

We examine whether the impact of ownership concentration on leverage differs across excess and lower control. We report that shareholders with excess control prefer leverage financing for an optimal capital structure and focus on value maximisation rather using leverage as a tool of minority shareholders' expropriation. Our analysis shows that firms capital structure significantly influences by the coalition of shareholders particularly decisions about leverage financing in addition to the firms' specific characteristics and institutional arrangements. Our empirical evidence shows that controlling shareholders with a lower fraction of equity are more concerned about limited holding thus prefer leverage over equity financing to inflate their equity stake to protect them from the potential takeovers and mergers. We report that capital structure decisions in Singapore are linked with the trade-off between the controlling shareholders' target of mitigating firm risk and their non-dilution entrenchment needs. Further, we found an inverted U-shaped association between control ownership and leverage financing. In terms of moderating effect of family-controlled ownership, our findings exhibit that leverage financing is less pronounced for family firms in Singapore due to the under-diversified investment portfolio.", "journal": "International Review of Financial Analysis", "volume": "72", "issue_number": null, "keywords": ["Ownership concentration", "Control rights", "Cash flow rights", "Leverage", "Family ownership", "Agency theory"], "fingerprints": ["Leverage", "Ownership", "Shareholders", "Shareholder", "Enterprise", "Financing", "Decision", "Control"], "publication_year": "2020", "publication_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/shareholders-control-rights-family-ownership-and-the-firms-levera"},

Design/methodology/approach: Acquirers’ systematic risk (beta) is calculated using the capital asset pricing model. The change in acquirers’ beta post-merger is obtained using event study and tested for mean differences across various sub-categories of deals. Cross-sectional regressions are then performed to test several hypotheses relating to the impact of diversification, method of payment, target status and prior experience on acquirers’ risk. Findings: For the overall sample, the evidence suggests that acquirers’ beta tends to increase post-merger, but only in cases where their pre-merger risk is relatively low in relation to the risk of the market. The authors also show that cash payment deals for publicly listed targets contribute to reducing acquirers’ risk while stock payment increase risk. Diversification, whether global or across industry, has no significant impact on risk. On the other hand, for serial acquirers, the risk is increased significantly with more M&As. Originality/value: This study contributes in a unique way by providing global evidence on acquirers’ systematic risk using a very large and diverse sample of M&A deals and investigating not only the impact of diversification on risk but also of other deal characteristics (e.g. method of payment, target status, acquirers’ prior experience) which have not been previously examined.", "journal": "Managerial Finance", "volume": "45", "issue_number": "4", "keywords": ["Acquirers’ beta", "CAPM", "Mergers and acquisitions", "Risk regressions", "Systematic risk", "Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)", "Finance"], "fingerprints": ["Payment System", "Merger", "Takeover", "Specific Industry", "Stock", "CAPM", "Beta Risk", "Enterprise"], "publication_year": "2019", "publication_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/mergers-and-acquisitions-implications-for-acquirers-market-risk"},

The emphasis is on assessing transparency and disclosure; auditing and compliance; risk management as indicators of corporate governance; and understanding how these parameters affect bank profitability, liquidity and the quality of loan portfolios. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 20 financial institutions was selected, with ten respondents from each, yielding a total sample size of 200. Principal component analysis (PCA), with inbuilt ability to check for composite reliability, was used to obtain composite indices for the corporate governance indicators as well as the indicators of financial performance, based on a set of questions framed for each institution. Findings: The analysis demonstrates that greater disclosure and transparency, improved auditing and compliance and better risk management positively affect the financial performance of financial institutions. In terms of significance, the results show that as the level of disclosure and transparency in managerial affairs increases, the performance of financial institutions – as measured in terms of the quality of loan portfolios, liquidity and profitability – increases by 0.3046, with the effect being statistically significant at the 1 per cent level. Furthermore, as the level of auditing and the degree of compliance with banking regulations increases, the financial performance of banks improves by 0.3309. Research limitations/implications: This paper did not consider time series because corporate governance does not change periodically. Practical implications: This paper demonstrates the importance of disclosure and transparency in managerial affairs because the performance of financial institutions, as measured in terms of loan portfolios, liquidity and profitability, increases by 0.4 when transparency and disclosure improve, with this effect being statistically significant at the 1 per cent level. Originality/value: The use of primary data in assessing the impact of corporate governance on financial performance, instead of secondary data, is the primary novelty of this study. Moreover, PCA is used to assess the weight of the various parameters.", "journal": "Governance", "volume": "19", "issue_number": "6", "keywords": ["Corporate governance", "Financial institutions", "Financial performance", "Principal component analysis", "Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)"], "fingerprints": ["Financial Institution", "Credit", "Liquidity", "Profitability", "Risk Management", "Principal Component Analysis", "Sample Size", "Time Series"], "publication_year": "2019", "publication_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/do-disclosure-and-transparency-affect-banks-financial-performance"},

Using a large sample of UK firms from the FTSE All-Share Index over the 2003–2011 period, we show a positive correlation between the presence of compensation consultants and CEO pay. Importantly, isolating this effect is somewhat dependent on the endogenous selection of consultants and the statistical modelling strategy deployed. We find evidence that compensation consultants improve CEO compensation design when their expertise is of greater importance (e.g. during the post-financial crisis period, or for firms that have particularly weak compensation policies). In addition, our findings show that compensation consultants increase CEO pay–performance sensitivity. The balance of evidence supports optimal contracting theory more than managerial power theory, but the authors caution the limits to this verification. We are careful to note that the more compelling evidence for the positive effect of pay consultants on CEOs is based on advanced methods (such as propensity score matching and difference-in-differences), and that more standard approaches (such as OLS and fixed effects) are unlikely to reveal the same level of causality of consultants on CEO pay.", "journal": "British Journal of Management", "volume": "30", "issue_number": "1", "keywords": ["General Business,Management and Accounting", "Strategy and Management", "Management of Technology and Innovation"], "fingerprints": ["Consultant", "Enterprise", "Financial Crisis", "Difference-In-Differences", "Share", "Managers", "Packaging", "Statistical Modeling"], "publication_year": "2019", "publication_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/do-compensation-consultants-drive-up-ceo-pay-evidence-from-uk-pub"},

A merchant who can find goods, before anyone else, at a lower price, may succeed in obtaining a higher profit margin for the resale, the researcher who first manages to discover a chemical formula or to invent a new design, can sale a new product. Therefore, science must always face a terrible trade-off between the private need to make profits and the social opportunity of scientific development. Information and knowledge undoubtedly represent a valuable competitive advantage for those who hold them [1-2]. The data holders, in order to continue to benefit from this advantage, try in every way to protect their secrecy. Innovation is a creative process, generated by the human mind, driven by completely different potential factors. Some economic theories claim that innovation is driven by competition. Conversely, other more recent theories highlight the advantages produced by information sharing [3-6].

It explores the nexus between primary food production, urban food and waste and outlined strategies to produce a more holistic food system. The chapter investigates the notion of 'urban consciousness' and its relationship with 'smart cities', and quality of life. It investigates issues around urban megaprojects in smart development. Some megaprojects radically transform but others backfire and waste resources or damage the environment. The indicative link between smart cities and university ranks, and extensive econometric evidence suggest that universities are central to smart cities. To manage development pressures and improve resource allocation, smart cities need reliable information systems.", "journal": null, "volume": null, "issue_number": null, "keywords": ["Economics, Econometrics and Finance(all)", "General Business,Management and Accounting"], "fingerprints": ["Smart City", "Smart Cities", "Universities", "Econometrics", "Wastes", "Food", "Economic and Social Development", "Resource Allocation"], "publication_year": "2017", "publication_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/conclusion-9"},

Notwithstanding controversy, macroeconomic turbulence, policy flux, project complexity and practical difficulties vary in diverse architectural, urban design, institutional and geographic settings.

Smart urban development involves multidisciplinary collaboration and widespread consultation. Big data and high-tech decision-support systems (DSS) can be part of the solution but not without administrative competency, civic professionalism and policy learning. Strategic plans should balance logistic infrastructure imperatives with ecological and local considerations. Institutionally, traditional planning confronts alternate policy foci. For Healy 'Clashes between conceptual frameworks and legitimising rationales are commonplace'. The rapidly evolving global economy accentuates stakeholder tensions. Urban regeneration quality is multifaceted but considerations include architecture and design merit, density and housing affordability, public realm enhancement, connective infrastructure. Smart development is adaptable and evolves in response to multiple pressures. It operates in a networked, collaborative system of vertical, horizontal and bottom-up local institutions.", "journal": null, "volume": null, "issue_number": null, "keywords": ["Economics, Econometrics and Finance(all)", "General Business,Management and Accounting"], "fingerprints": ["Development", "Policy", "Urban Development", "Learning", "Infrastructure", "Conceptual Framework", "Imperatives", "Economics"], "publication_year": "2017", "publication_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/smart-urban-planning"},

In turbulent times, a robust valuation system helps to regulate transactions and guide property investment. Reliable valuations are particularly important for Gulf cities like Dubai whose property and capital markets absorb regional oil and increasing Asian liquidity. The transformation of the Emirate from an inconsequential fishing village to a glittering global trade, tourism, financial and logistics hub stimulated property markets. However, the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC), continued regional instability and sustainably issues raise concerns. The research investigates whether the Emirati residential valuation system (RVS) is ‘fit for purpose’. Valuation system criteria included valuation output reasonableness, stakeholder information transparency, administrative capability, end-user trust and valuation standards salience. The research collected evidence, using embedded observations, transactions analysis, expert interviews and discussions. Initial results suggest that key UAE residential valuation system improvements should focus on information dissemination, institutional capabilities and dissemination of valuation standards.", "journal": null, "volume": null, "issue_number": null, "keywords": ["Capabilities", "Information systems", "Market value", "Residential valuation system", "Trust", "Valuation standards salience", "Economics, Econometrics and Finance(all)", "General Business,Management and Accounting"], "fingerprints": ["Standards", "Research", "Markets", "Transaction", "Information", "Global Trade", "Discussion", "Criterion"], "publication_year": "2017", "publication_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/valuation-systems-the-case-of-dubai"},

In particular, it explores (1) how common financial reporting fraud is in Egypt, (2) the perpetrators and victims of financial reporting fraud in Egypt and (3) how financial reporting fraud is committed and concealed in Egypt. The study sheds light on generic issues that could have implications for auditors and audit regulators. In addition, the study provides a detailed guide on how financial reporting fraud schemes are committed and concealed in Egypt, knowledge of which could help auditors design effective audit tests to assess fraud risk and help those charged with governance to design effective prevention and detection techniques. Egypt could be an attractive destination for international investors, therefore knowledge of the nature and victims of fraud in Egypt could help investors make informed decisions about where to invest their money. The results of this study could also help regulators in Egypt as well as World Trade Organizations determine where to focus their support and enforcement efforts.", "journal": "Third World Quarterly", "volume": "40", "issue_number": "11", "keywords": ["Egypt", "Financial reporting fraud", "external auditors", "fraud detection", "fraud risk assessment", "Development"], "fingerprints": ["Fraud", "Egypt", "Knowledge", "Accounting", "Financial Reporting", "Investors", "Auditors", "Understanding"], "publication_year": "2019", "publication_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/understanding-financial-reporting-fraud-in-egypt-evidence-from-th"},

The authors suggest that integrated thinking is an internal process that organizations can follow to increase the level of disclosure on IR that can be used as an effective mechanism to enhance accountability with stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach: International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) guidelines and content analysis are used to analyze IR content elements in HEI reports from 2014-2016. Findings: The results indicate a significant increase in the trend and extent of IR content elements. The HEI-specific characteristics examined, such as establishment of HEI; adoption of IR framework and governing board size are all statistically and positively associated with IR content elements disclosure. This paper introduces signalling theory to explore the idea that appropriate communication via integrated thinking can close the gap between the organization and its stakeholders via increased level of disclosure on IR content elements. Practical implications: The results will assist policymakers and regulators to assess the benefits of voluntary implementation of IR at HEIs and evaluate possible mandatory implementation of IIRC guidelines. Second, the findings can assist managers of institutions interested in implementing IR. Social implications: This study recommends universities to explicitly address IR issues in reporting, as this will increase their impact as leaders of educational thought in addition to their roles as partners, advisors, counselors and assessors. Originality/value: This study explores whether HEIs in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales provide disclosure on IIRC content elements as a reflection of integrated thinking and whether the connectivity and interdependence between different departments will help to signal to stakeholders how HEIs create value for society.", "journal": "Social Responsibility Journal", "volume": "17", "issue_number": "3", "keywords": ["Integrated reporting", "Signalling Theory", "Integrated thinking", "content analysis", "Signalling theory", "Content analysis", "Higher education institutions", "General Business,Management and Accounting", "Social Sciences (miscellaneous)"], "fingerprints": ["Institution", "UK", "Higher Education", "Content", "Disclosure", "Northern Ireland", "Stakeholder", "Thinking"], "publication_year": "2020", "publication_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/integrated-reporting-in-higher-education-insights-from-scotland-n"},

Design/methodology/approach: The six years of secondary data, including the annual reports of 2013–2018, were collected from the websites of all the seven listed Islamic banks, i.e. 100% of the population available during the period of study. The study used a content analysis approach for systematically categorizing and analysing the contents disclosed in the annual report. A total compliance score based on 133 reporting items of IFSB standard-4 were considered for content analysis. Furthermore, this study applied the ordinary least square to investigate the impact of corporate governance on IFSB standard-4. Findings: This study found that the level of compliance with the IFSB standard by the Islamic banks in Bangladesh is poor, as the overall compliance status is 44.83%. Further, this study observed a significant and positive influence of the Shari’ah supervisory committee, the board size, accounting experts on the board, foreign ownership and institutional ownership on the level of compliance with IFSB standard-4. On the other hand, this study found a negative effect of directors’ ownership on the level of compliance with IFSB standard-4. Practical implications: This study provides the management of Islamic banks an insight into developing their governance characteristics to comply with Islamic accounting and reporting standards. Moreover, this study expects to facilitate the management of Islamic banks in designing their accounting and reporting outlines to enhance the level of compliance with the IFSB standards. Originality/value: This pioneering study on IFSB standards opens an avenue to the researchers exploring the accounting and reporting status of Islamic banks considering the requirements of the IFSB standards.", "journal": "International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management", "volume": "15", "issue_number": "1", "keywords": ["Bangladesh", "Compliance status", "Corporate governance", "IFSB standards", "Islamic banks", "Business and International Management", "Finance"], "fingerprints": ["Financial Services", "Standards", "Banks", "Compliance", "Ownership", "Accounting", "Bangladesh", "Annual Report"], "publication_year": "2022", "publication_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/corporate-governance-and-ifsb-standard-4-evidence-from-islamic-ba"},

Using a sample of the FTSE All-Share Index firms listed on the London Stock Exchange for the period 2009 to 2018 and the ordinary least squares regression (OLS) estimation method, we find that cost of debt is higher for firms with CEOs in their early tenure in office than those in their later tenure in office. Further analysis shows that board independence attributes including (1) the proportion of independent directors on the board, (2) full (100%) independent audit committee members, and (3) a lead independent director representation on the board interact with CEO early tenure in office to reduce cost of debt due to the board’s effective monitoring ability when the CEO is new and risk-seeking. Our study extends CEO tenure and corporate outcomes in general and in particular CEO risk-taking incentives and cost of debt literature, and has important implications for firms seeking to raise finance from the debt market when their CEO is new as well as identifying the control mechanisms that they need to put in place to lower the cost of debt.", "journal": "Review of Quantitative Finance and Accounting", "volume": "59", "issue_number": "2", "keywords": ["Board independence", "CEO tenure", "Cost of debt", "Accounting", "General Business,Management and Accounting", "Finance"], "fingerprints": ["Cost of Debt", "Office", "Enterprise", "Finance", "Director", "Monitoring", "Indexes", "Risk Taking"], "publication_year": "2022", "publication_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/ceo-tenure-and-cost-of-debt"},

The extremely large-scale drawdown across the markets signifies an indiscriminate impact. To some extent, Asian Islamic markets show relative resilience to their counterparts.

It appears that a higher return leads to a smaller maximum drawdown, while higher volatility leads to a larger maximum drawdown. Despite the large-scale drawdown, a number of markets secure a positive return where Islamic markets outperform the counterparts.

The rising cases of financial mismanagement, which was associated with the financial management behavior of top administrators in these SOEs, prompted this study. It is believed that identifying the factors that determine the financial management behavior of these administrators would help to find solutions to the problem. Based on the multistage sampling technique, 385 top administrators from the SOEs at the federal level in Nigeria participated in the survey. Quantitative analysis was used to analyze the data and the results show that income, family size, and financial literacy are the most important factors affecting the financial management behavior of the administrators. It is recommended that there should be an improvement in income and other working conditions of the administrators in the SOEs since income has been confirmed to be an important shift factor of financial management behavior. In the same vein, given the role of family size, it is recommended that efforts on population reduction should be intensified.

The role of financial literacy", "authors": ["Rayenda Khresna Brahmana", " Maria Kontesa"], "departments": "School of Economics, Finance and Accounting", "organizations": ["School of Economics, Finance and Accounting", "Universitas Widya Dharma Pontianak "], "abstract": "Purpose: This research aims to examine how financial literacy moderates the mediation of attitude toward virtual influencers’ non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or ATB on the relationship between purchase intention and self-congruity, which includes symbolic representation, self-image congruence and emotional value. Initially, we investigated the mediation effect of ATB on the relationship between self-congruity and purchase intention. Subsequently, we analyze how financial literacy moderates this mediation process. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed a sample of 383 virtual influencers’ fans and applied a partial least square structural equation model (PLS-SEM) along with robustness tests to test the research hypothesis. The analysis is based on the moderated mediation framework. Findings: The findings are intriguing for several reasons. First, it reveals that only self-image congruence positively affects purchase intention, contrary to existing self-congruity theory literature. The relationship between self-image congruence and purchase intention is a direct relationship with no mediation effect of ATB. Second, ATB fails to mediate the self-congruity effect on purchase intention. Third, financial literacy has a negative relationship with purchase intention, indicating that fans of virtual influencers with higher financial literacy are less likely to purchase virtual influencers’ NFTs due to more critical investment evaluations. We also argue that financial literacy discards the consumption behavior effect from self-congruity variables on purchase intention. Research limitations/implications: The study contributes to the literature by emphasizing the significance of financial literacy on purchase intention under the self-congruity framework. It also surmises that self-image congruence does matter for the purchase intention of a virtual influencer’s NFT. However, further research could validate findings by studying broader NFT investors, incorporating fandom and impulse buying variables and examining actual NFT purchases against planned behavior. Practical implications: This research is crucial for virtual influencers’ NFT creators, marketers and fans by providing insights for evaluating virtual influencers’ creators’ decision to pursue NFT markets. The findings reveal that the creators of virtual influencers should reconsider pursuing the NFT market, as self-congruity may not be a driving factor. Notably, our findings imply that a virtual influencer’s NFT is significantly different from a virtual influencer's merchandising business. Originality/value: The originality of this study lies in extending the self-congruity within the NFT context, investigating how financial literacy moderates the mediation of ATB on the self-congruity-purchase intention relationship. It challenges self-congruity theory by showing that despite fans feeling aligned with virtual influencers, high financial literacy reduces the congruence.", "journal": "Information Technology and People", "volume": "(In-Press)", "issue_number": null, "keywords": ["Financial literacy", "Non-fungible tokens", "Purchase intention", "Virtual influencers", "Information Systems", "Computer Science Applications", "Library and Information Sciences"], "fingerprints": ["Influencer", "Merchandising"], "publication_year": "2025", "publication_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/does-self-congruity-matter-for-virtual-influencers-non-fungible-t"}
